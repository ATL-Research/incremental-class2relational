## TODO

- [ ] write this readme
- [ ] choose a licence for the repo
    - EPL v2 ?
- [ ] add metamodels
    - [x] add change metamodel
    - [ ] add source metamodel
    - [ ] add target metamodel
- [ ] add source models for "correctness"
    - [ ] generate sample source models
        - manually ?
        - taken from zoo ?
    - [ ] generate change model
        - using fuzzer ?
        - manually ?
- [ ] add test cases for "completeness"
    - [ ] identify which test to perform
        - for each test
            - create source model(s) + change + expected results
- [ ] java driver
    - [ ] code the AbstractDriver
        - read env variable
        - loads models
        - apply change
        - save results
    - [ ] package it to lib ?
    - [ ] write documentation for other languages
    - embed fuzzer so that solutions can test if they are correct on more case than the one we provide ?
- [ ] script to launch solutions and perform tests
    - python ? bash ? ...
    - we need to agree on how solutions declare how to run their executable
    - [ ] make a CLI executable from model comparator to check if models are similar
    - automate testing so that checking is done by github actions ?
    - generate report ?
