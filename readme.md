## TODO

- [ ] [SH] repo tasks
    - [ ] move TODO to issues & milestone
    - [ ] write this readme
    - [ ] choose a licence for the repo
        - EPL v2 ?
        - GPL v?
        - MIT
- [ ] [TLC] - URGENT - add metamodels
    - [ ] add change metamodel
        - check if we need to update it (adding, removing, updating)
            - if so, give a proper description of the new semantic of the model
    - [ ] add source metamodel
        - [TLC] use the one present on my computer
            - check how far it is from original one
            - removed Class:super and Class::isAbstract
    - [ ] add target metamodel
        - reuse zoo one
- [ ] add source models for "correctness"
    - [ ] [SG+MC] generate sample source models
        - ~~manually ?~~
        - generate from real ecore using ECore2Class transformation 
            - may need update with regard to removal of isAbstract & super
        - ~~taken from zoo ?~~
    - [ ] [??] generate change model
        - [??] manually
        - using fuzzer is we need more
- [ ] add test cases for "completeness"
    - [ ] identify which test to perform
        - for each test
            - create source model(s) + change + expected results
- [ ] [TLC] java driver
    - [ ] code the AbstractDriver
        - read env variable
        - loads models
        - apply change
        - save results
    - [ ] package it to lib ?
    - [ ] write documentation for other languages
    - embed fuzzer so that solutions can test if they are correct on more case than the one we provide ?
- [ ] solutions
    - [ ] ATL batch
    - [ ] ATOL
        - labelling ?
    - [ ] java incremental
- [ ] script to launch solutions and perform tests
    - python ? bash ? ...
    - we need to agree on how solutions declare how to run their executable
    - [ ] make a CLI executable from model comparator to check if models are similar
    - low priority - automate testing so that checking is done by github actions ?
    - generate report ?
