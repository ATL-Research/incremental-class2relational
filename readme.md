## Using Github maven repository

We provide two maven packages, the fuzzer / model comparator and the solution driver with metamodels, they are hosted on Github. They are published publicly but Github requires users to authenticate to access their maven repository.

For a Gradle example you can read the repository declaration from [ATOL build.gradle file](solutions/atol/transformation/build.gradle). To generate your credentials you can read Github documentation [for maven](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages) or [Gradle].
